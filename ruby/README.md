## Set Game

Ruby script version of [set game](http://www.setgame.com/).

### Play game

It is close to imposibble to enjoy script version, but if you would like to give it a try:

```
$ ruby play_set_game.rb
```

Or you can play my react/redux version [HERE](http://testingthings.herokuapp.com/)

### Rules of the game

Check [README](https://github.com/aneta-bielska/set_game).

### Tests

Bunch of tests:

`rake test`

### TODO

* easy | advanced (?)
* infinite game (?)
